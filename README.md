Jessica Lee's CLPS 0950 Solo Final Project

"What Language is This?"

For this final project, I have created a program for linguistic analysis. The goal of this program is to read a body of text (input by you; about a few sentences long), and guess what language the text is written in (output the answer). The four options of languages are English, Spanish, French, and (Brazilian) Portuguese.

Instructions:
- To begin, press the 'Run Cell' button on the code. This will prompt you to enter text into a text box below.
- Input a few sentences of text in one of the four chosen languages (English, Spanish, French, or Portuguese).
- Press the enter key and watch the code work its magic! Hopefully, the detected language will be an accurate match!
